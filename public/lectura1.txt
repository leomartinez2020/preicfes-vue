<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">The World's Favorite Food</h2>
<p>According to information collected in 17 countries, pasta is what people like to eat most. Not only
is pasta the number one food in its home country, Italy, but it is also enjoyed in distant places
like the Philippines, Mexico and South Africa. Italy is the biggest pasta-eating community of the
world. Italy is followed by Venezuela, then Tunisia.</p>
<p>Pasta has become popular because it is a low-cost meal and it is not difficult to prepare. Just
cook spaghetti or other forms of pasta with tomato to go with it and youâ€™re finished. It tastes
delicious and fills your stomach. It also produces energy, which is why athletes eat pasta.</p>
<p>Before it became popular in Italy during the 19th century, earlier civilizations ate some forms of
pasta. People say that by the 13th century Marco Polo brought pasta to Italy from China, but this
is not true. Arabs brought a noodle-like pasta to Sicily, an island in Italy, in the 8th century.</p>
<p>When many Italians immigrated to America in the 20th century, they took their eating habits
with them, so pasta and pizza became popular. Although many people think of spaghetti as the
most popular form of pasta, there are over 600 types and they are cooked in different ways.
Pasta has simple ingredients, so it can be kept longer.</p>
