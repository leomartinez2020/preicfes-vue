<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">Television</h2>
<p>Life is short! Who has time to waste? Not me. If you are really honest with yourself
you´ll notice that you may be spending too much time watching television and there
are better things you could be doing. Whether you watch television or not is your
decision. But consider this first.</p>

<p>Some people say TV is educational, but it is an ineffective medium for learning.
Though there is a great variety of programs and sometimes they are interesting, many TV shows offer information that
is not accurate. If you really want to learn something, you should read it for yourself.</p>

<p>TV can help you keep informed and it is necessary to know what is happening to people and places around you.
However, if you watch the average news program, you have to waste a long time on useless information. If you really
want to be up-to-date, read the newspaper; it is more detailed and you can choose which stories you read.</p>

<p>The average adult spends about 2 hours a day watching TV. Let´s say you lived to age 60; you would have spent 5
years of your life in front of the television. Not only could you be catching up with your family during that time (since
watching TV with them it is not real interaction), but you are also preventing yourself from having new experiences. Do
you know what you could do with those extra years? Here´s some advice: create some art, talk to people, exercise,
learn a foreign language or how to play an instrument.</p>

<p>Using those two hours a day for something you “don't have time for,” will make you have time for a lot more.</p>
